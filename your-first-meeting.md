## Attending your first PR Review Club

If you’re thinking about attending PR Review Club, welcome! We love new
participants. Below is information to help you get started as a first-timer.

The club meets on {{ site.meeting_day }}s at {{ site.meeting_time }} in
{{ site.meeting_location }}. Every second week, an LDK developer will
host a 60-minute discussion on an LDK pull request. [The
code of conduct](https://ldk.reviews/code-of-conduct) details the
behavior we expect from all participants.

You’ll get the most out of Review Club if you’ve reviewed the PR going into the
meeting, but it’s definitely not mandatory in order to attend. You can always
show up as an observer.

If you’d like to more actively participate, you should clone the relevant repository
from the [Lightning Dev Kit org](https://github.com/lightningdevkit). You should also
check out and build the PR branch locally and run all tests. Take time to review the
code changes and read the comments on that week’s PR.

There are also notes and questions you can review and prepare. Make a note
of any questions you want to ask.

The meeting will begin with “hi” from that week’s host. Feel free to respond with
“hi” so people know you’re at your keyboard and participating. The host will poll
everyone on whether they've reviewed the PR (y/n). Don't feel embarrassed to say "n".

Questions may be asked at any time. If you’d like to ask a question, 
there's no need to ask permission. If the question is off-topic, the host will kindly
let you know. The host will end the session at the end of the hour. Thanking the host
at the end of the meeting is always appreciated!

Follow the [PR Review Club on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BitcoinCorePRs) for
announcements on that week’s PR or schedule changes.

**We look forward to having you at the next PR Review Club!**
