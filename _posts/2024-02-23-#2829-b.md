## Notes
  This is part two of the review for [bLIP/31] named "Mutual Message
  Exchange".  In the first session we reviewed the [bLIP/31]
  definition, and in this part we will cover the implementation at
  [ldk/2829].

## Questions
1. Did you review bLIP31? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
2. What are the main changes in this PR?
3. In `mutual-message-exchange/src/lib.rs` we have three public
   functions, `respond_with_message`, `decode_message`, and
   `get_init_bytes`. What are the main purposes of these functions?
4. What is the purpose of `get_idx_permutation`
   `get_cover_trusted_count` functions?
5. What do we save in the `TrustedSet` struct and why?
6. What is `variable_time_decryption` and how is it used in the code?
7. What are the use cases of `mutual-message-exchange`?
