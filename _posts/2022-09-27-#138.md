## Notes

* libsecp256k1-zkp is a C cryptographic library for experimental EC cryptosystems, e.g [ECDSA
sign-to-contract](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/master/include/secp256k1_ecdsa_s2c.h), [ECDSA adaptor](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/master/include/secp256k1_ecdsa_adaptor.h), [MuSig2](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/master/include/secp256k1_musig.h) and [rangeproofs](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/master/include/secp256k1_rangeproof.h).
* This library is an upstream fork of [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1). While libsecp256k1 scope is stricly the cryptosystems required to validate consensus rules, libsecp256k1-zkp aims to encompass any Bitcoin-related cryptosystems.
* [#138](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/pull/138) is an implementation of [Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf), a threshold multi-party signature scheme.

## Questions

1. What's [elliptic curve cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) ? What's the base mathematic assumption providing hardness of the cryptosystems (e.g compared to [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem) ? What's the fundamental concepts of ECC and how they interrelate ?
2. What's [ECDSA](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf), the original signature scheme supported by Bitcoin consensus rules ? What's [Schnorr](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-46885-4_68.pdf), the novel signature scheme soft-forked in 2021 ?
3. [MuSig2](https://github.com/jonasnick/bips/blob/musig2/bip-musig2.mediawiki) is anotherr multi-party signature scheme. What's the fundamental difference compared to FROST ?
4. What are the properties of the FROST scheme (e.g unbound concurrency, efficiency, etc) ?
5. What are the operations and their outcomes followed by FROST key-generation, preprocessing and signing phases ?
6. What are the advantages of using FROST in a [Lightning node deployment context](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/1665) ?
